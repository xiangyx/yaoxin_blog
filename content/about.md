title: About Me
---

I like non-measure-theoretical statistics or statistics without much measure theory, and its application in fields such as data science and finance. Among the programming language I used, R is the most familiar one and my favorite, and Python is catching up.

I was born and raised in China, moved to Denmark for master's study, and now live and work in Copenhagen, which you love and hate.

I am addicted to spicy food. Without chili my world would be gray.
